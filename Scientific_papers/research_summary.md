# Scientific Research on AI-Based Psychological Analysis Through Drawing

## Current Research Landscape

### 1. AI Applications in Psychological Analysis

Recent research indicates growing interest in applying artificial intelligence to psychological assessment through visual means. The field is rapidly evolving with applications spanning from clinical psychology to art therapy.

### 2. Drawing Analysis in Psychology

Traditional drawing analysis in psychology has a long history, including methods like:
- House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test
- Draw-A-Person Test
- Kinetic Family Drawing
- Mandala Art Therapy

These approaches rely on trained psychologists to interpret symbolic meanings, spatial relationships, color usage, and other drawing elements.

### 3. Machine Learning for Creativity Assessment

Panfilova et al. (2024) explored explainable AI methods for creativity assessment based on drawings. Their study compared various AI models for determining creativity levels using the Urban test, and analyzed which drawing features most influenced model predictions.

### 4. AI-Generated Art and Psychological Impact

Wang and Xiao (2025) investigated anxiety induced by AI painting tools, examining multidimensional social-psychological anxieties related to privacy violation, bias, job replacement, and learning anxiety.

## Technological Approaches

### 1. Feature Extraction from Drawings

Current AI approaches extract features such as:
- Spatial relationships
- Line quality (pressure, continuity)
- Symmetry and balance
- Use of space
- Color choices
- Drawing completion time
- Shape accuracy when copying models

### 2. GANs and Generative Models

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like GauGAN show promise in transforming simple sketches into more detailed artistic expressions, potentially revealing deeper psychological states through artistic transformations.

### 3. AI in Therapeutic Applications

Ethically designed AI systems are being developed to support clinical decision-making in healthcare and mental health settings, with emphasis on fairness, transparency, and mitigation of potential biases (Liefgreen et al., 2024).

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

1. **Validation**: Limited large-scale validation of AI-based drawing analysis compared to traditional psychological assessments

2. **Standardization**: Need for standardized methods in extracting psychological insights from drawing behaviors

3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Importance of addressing cultural variations in drawing expression and interpretation

4. **Longitudinal Studies**: Few studies tracking changes in psychological states through drawing analysis over time

5. **Integrated Approaches**: Opportunity to combine drawing analysis with other psychological measures for more comprehensive assessment

## Conclusion

The intersection of AI, drawing analysis, and psychological assessment represents a promising frontier in mental health technology. While significant progress has been made in technological capabilities, more research is needed to validate these approaches and establish clinical best practices.
